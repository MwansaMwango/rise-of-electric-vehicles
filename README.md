### Introduction
From carts to steam and hydrocarbon vehicles, mankind is now entering a new phase of transportation.  Electric Vehicles are set to takeover this decade as the primary type of vehicle on our roads. 

### Project proposal
1. Research what recent, historical data is available on EV manufacturing and usage.
2. Extract, transform and load the data into a Mongo database.
3. Develop a web site for user to visualise the data.  Pages will include:
--* An interactive landing page to allow users to filter information e.g. Date ranges
--* A Leaflet map showing use of EV's worldwide.  A seperate layer for manufacturing locations and charging stations.
--* Graph visualisations on EV data
--* Race chart graph on the rise of EV's using the raceplotly library (a library not used in class)
--* Details page showing a table of data that the visualisation pages are based on.
